Installation
------------

* Currently tested Linux distributions and Web browsers:

    - Ubuntu Desktop/Server 12.04 or later 
    - Linux Mint 17.0 or later 
    - Debian 7.1 or later 
    - CentOS 6.0 or later 
    - Fedora 21 or later
    - Firefox 3.6 or later 
    - Google Chrome 13.0.x or later 

 This software may work on other Linux distributions derived from or 
 corresponding to the above distributions. However, you will need to 
 edit the installer script to do it.
 
 Currently, Internet Explorer's Javascript API is NOT supported. Sorry.


* Required additional libraries and tools:

    - Building tools(gcc, make, etc.)
    - libcap2 / libcap2-bin
    - libssl-dev(OpenSSL)
    - libxml2-dev(Gnome libxml2)
    - libsqlite3-dev(SQLite)
    - libxml-libxml-perl
    - perl-libwww-perl
    - libswitch-perl
    - libjson-perl [Optional]
    - libgtk2-perl [Optional]
    - bridge-utils [Optional]
    - iptables / ip6tables [Optional]

 This software's installer script tries to install these additional 
 packages by apt-get or yum command. Of cource, you can install these
 manually before running the installer srcript.

Before running the installer script, please update package information 
(e.g. sudo apt-get update or yum update). 

If you configure a Split DNS for your VPN (IPv6), it requires kernel  
v3.7 and later (supporting IPv6 NAT) and corresponding ip6tables 
(e.g. Ubuntu 13.04 or later). 



* Install Rockhopper VPN software:

   (1) Download this software's package(rockhopper-<version>.tgz).
   (2) Update package information. (e.g. sudo apt-get update or yum update)
   (3) tar zxvf rockhopper-<version>.tgz
   (4) cd rockhopper-<version>
   (5) sudo ./install.sh       
       *:Please run the installer script as root.

 If you install this software on a distribution whose firewall policy is 
 'default deny' like CentOS, you may need to configure the firewall to 
 allow IPsec(IP protocol: ESP(50)) and IKEv2(IP protocol: UDP(17), 
 ports: 500 and 4500) traffic. 



* Install Rockhopper VPN software with debug trace tools:

 If you want to test, develop or hack Rockhopper VPN software, it is 
 useful to install additional debug trace tools, too. 
 Please read "Documents/Debug Trace" on our project site to get more 
 detailed information before the installation.

  - http://rockhoppervpn.sourceforge.net/dev_dbgtrace.html

 Please install like this: 

  (4) sudo ./install_dbg.sh    
      *:Please run the installer script as root.


 Incidentally, if you want to build Rockhopper with no optimization 
 (gcc -O0), please install like this:

  (4) sudo ./debug_tools/install_dbg_no_optmz.sh 
      *:Please run the installer script as root.
      
 To enable most debug flags (see rhp_misc.h), run the installer 
 like this:

  (4) sudo ./debug_tools/install_dbg_all.sh 
      *:Please run the installer script as root.



* Uninstall Rockhopper

 If you want to uninstall this software, please use the 'uninstall.sh' 
 script in the same directory.





Getting Started
----------------

 Now you can open Rockhopper Web console by Web browser like firefox. 

 Default URL of the top page is 'http://127.0.0.1:32501/'.

 Also, you can start it by launcher in the Start Menu or in the Unity 
 dashboard (Ubuntu). 

 Default administrator's information:
   Name: admin
   Password: secret


 [CAUTION]
  Please change the password immediately. You can do this on 
  Web console's "Management" tab pane.





Installation on the non-GUI environment
----------------------------------------

 By default, Rockhopper's Web management service is open on loopback 
 address(http://127.0.0.1:32501/) only. When you install this software 
 on a distribution without GUI like Ubuntu Server, it is useful to 
 configure an additional address and port remotely accessible from 
 other PCs. You can setup this by rockhopper management tool.


  # rockhopper web-mng -mng_address <the machine's IPv4> -admin admin -password <password>
  # sudo /etc/init.d/rockhopper restart
  or 
  # sudo systemctl restart rockhopper

 (Example)
 ---
 # ip addr s dev eth0
 2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP 
    group default qlen 1000
     link/ether 00:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
     inet 192.168.20.100/24 brd 192.168.20.255 scope global eth0
          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
     inet6 fe80::xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx/64 scope link 
        valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever


 # rockhopper web-mng -mng_address 192.168.20.100
 Admin Name: admin
 Password: secret

 # sudo /etc/init.d/rockhopper restart
 or
 # sudo systemctl restart rockhopper
 ---

 Now you can access "http://192.168.20.100:32501/" remotely by Web browser.

 [CAUTION]
  Communication between Rockhopper's Web management service and
  Web browsers is NOT encrypted. So, you should access the 
  management service on protected network/LAN. 



Enjoy!


[Appendix: 1] Simple VPN Client GUI: Manually installing a gtk2-perl package. 
              (Ubuntu/LinuxMint/Debian).
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Rockhopper's simple VPN Client GUI needs a GTK2-perl package. You can install 
it manually.

  - Open a Terminal window.

  - Install it by apt-get. 

    $ sudo apt-get install libgtk2-perl



[Appendix: 2] Simple VPN Client GUI: Building a gtk2-perl package on your 
              CentOS/Fedora system.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Rockhopper's simple VPN Client GUI needs a GTK2-perl package. In case of 
CentOS/Fedora, it may not be distributed on default repositories. If you
can't find the 'perl-Gtk2' package on the third-party repositories, you need 
to build it from a source package.


- Available Repositories for CentOS > Third Party Repositories.
  http://wiki.centos.org/AdditionalResources/Repositories


The follwoings are just an example procedure to do it. You may need to find 
other better ways.


- Open a Terminal window.

- Just to make sure, try to install a perl-Gtk2 package from the default 
  repositories. It may fail. 

$ sudo yum install perl-Gtk2 


- If failed, configure a third-party repository. [e.g.] repoforge(rpmforge)

$ wget http://pkgs.repoforge.org/rpmforge-release/rpmforge-release-0.5.3-1.el7.rf.x86_64.rpm
You may get it for 32bits or a newer one from the repoforge's site 
(http://pkgs.repoforge.org/rpmforge-release/).

$ sudo rpm -ivh rpmforge-release-*.rpm
$ sudo yum update rpmforge-release

- Disable the third-party repository by default.

$ sudo vi /etc/yum.repos.d/rpmforge.repo
 ...
 enable=0
 ...


- First, try to get the package from this repository. It may fail.

$ sudo yum install --enablerepo=rpmforge perl-Gtk2


- If failed, try to build the GTK2-perl package from a source package. Before starting it, 
  you may need to install additional packages.

$ sudo yum install gcc make perl-ExtUtils-MakeMaker pango-devel gtk2-devel 
  perl-Time-HiRes perl-local-lib perl-CPAN

$ sudo yum install --enablerepo=rpmforge perl-ExtUtils-PkgConfig perl-ExtUtils-Depends


- Install additional perl modules from CPAN (http://www.cpan.org/).

$ sudo perl -MCPAN -e shell
  cpan[n]> install Test::More
  cpan[n]> install Glib
  cpan[n]> install Cairo
  cpan[n]> install Pango



- Get a GTK2-perl package from the project site (http://sourceforge.net/projects/gtk2-perl/files/Gtk2/)
  and build it.

$ tar xfvz Gtk2-<version>.tar.gz 
$ cd Gtk2-<version>
$ perl Makefile.PL
$ make
$ make test
$ sudo make install
